# M1_Numbersystems-Conversion_Utilities
Conversion from one number system to another 

## Milestone -1
* Idea
* Requirements
 Description
  Describe the project
  Computers use binary number system and understanding number systems and their inter conversion is necessary in order to understand computers.This Project is to help the learners do inter conversion of numbersystem and verify their results.
# Requirements

## High Level Requirements
 Features of project
 * To give a Introduction of different  
   number systems
 * Provide Techniques to convert from one 
 number system to another 
 * Provide a feature to practice the examples 
 * Conduct a test to check the understanding of the learner 
 

## Low Level Requirements
 * The Concepts,Techniques and Examples are displayed to the learner step by step from the available information about the Number Systems and the learner needs to read and learn.
 * Questions are displayed for the learner and the learner needs to enter the solution for the question
 * The learner can practice by entering the question and the solution for the question will be displayed
 
 
## SWOT ANALYSIS
* Strength - The Interactive system helps the learner to understand better and the Learner can get an idea of his Understanding through the test that is conducted.
* Weakness - Learners who are weak at understanding by Reading may find it difficult.
